Branching in Git
======================
This is a feature of git which allows developers to create multiple branches for each functionality and create the code related to that functionality on that branch
This helps in creating the code in an uncluttered way

1 To see the list of branches (local)
  git branch

2 To see the list of all the branches (local and remote)
  git branch -a

3 To create a branch
  git branch branch_name

4 To move into a branch
  git checkout branch_name

5 To create a branch and also move into it
  git checkout -b branch_name

7 To merge a branch
  git merge branch_name

8 To delete a branch that is merged
  git branch -d branch_name 
  This is also called as soft delete

9 To delete a branch that is not merged
  git branch -D branch_name
  This is called hard delete

Note: At the time of creating a branch what ever is the commit history of the parent branch will get copied into the newly created branch

Note: A file can be created or modified on any branch but git will 
consider only the branch from where it is commited
